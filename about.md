I am a first year graduate student in the Master of Statistics program. I am taking 12 credits this semester:
* ST501 Fundamentals of Statistical Inference I
* ST534 Applied Time Series
* ST558 Data Science for Statisticians
* ST563 Intro to Statistical Learning

Additionally, I am working on a side project that involves mapping relationships between GMs in sports leagues and studying tendencies to utilize past relationships. This project involves data scraping, backend api development, frontend development, and docker/AWS deployment. Picture below:
