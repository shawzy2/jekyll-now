Using the finance api vended by [Polygon](https://polygon.io/), I explored some characteristics of stocks and markets within the past year.
Something interesting I found is that when stocks move by at least 5% on any given day, it is likely that volitility increases as well. 
Also, I found that volitility among crypto markets is the most, then stocks, and forex markets have the lowest volitility. 

To make this possible, I created 6 helper functions that call various api endpoints. The two functions I used to generate graphs hit the endpoints 
[Aggregate](https://polygon.io/docs/get_v2_aggs_ticker__stocksTicker__range__multiplier___timespan___from___to__anchor) and 
[Grouped Daily](https://polygon.io/docs/get_v2_aggs_grouped_locale_us_market_stocks__date__anchor).

The hardest part about this project is debugging in the rmarkdown environment. For most of this project, I would test codes in the r console and 
transfer code into rmarkdown after I got the desired output. However, throughout some parts of the code, the rmarkdown rendering would throw errors when
the same code run in the console would run correctly. In the future, I will use the run button inside rmarkdown to ensure that codes runs as expected.
