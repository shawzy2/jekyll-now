title: Data Scientist vs Statistician 2
---

I think the field of data science is all about integrating skills found in computer science and statistics to solve real-world business problems. Examples can be forcasting weather or prediciting baseball player performance and using these insights to influence business action. Skills neccessary include a solid foundation in probability and statistics, experience in programming languages and data structures, and a strong understanding of the language/challenges surrounding a business domain. 

Per this [article](https://mixpanel.com/blog/this-is-the-difference-between-statistics-and-data-science/), data science roles seem to be different from statistician roles in that DS is more about applying statistical principles to problems. Whereas statisticians are likely doing pure research to discover new statistical methods. I see myself more comfortable in the former, as my work experience (2 software internships) is mostly engineering work.
