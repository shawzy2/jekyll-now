## Programming Background

Coming from a computer science background, much of my experience is with
Python and Java. Alternatively, I have used SAS, Julia, and Matlab for
math/statistics electives. But for data analysis, I prefer Python.

I am not a fan of R. I think Python is easier for data mining
(integration with databases, api’s), data transformation (pandas and
numpy libraries), and statistical analysis (sklearn and scipy).
Additionally, Python integrates with the rest of the software
development lifecycle, whereas R does not. However, I do think R is
useful for quickly creating markdown files and integrating within
research documents.

I think Python is easier to learn than R due to more Python tutorials
available. Any question you might have about python, it seems there is
an answer on stackoverflow or a medium article addressing it. R does not
seem as easy to find answers to questions – although that could be
because I am a noob with R and do not know how to debug issues via
Google.

## Example R Markdown Output

``` r
plot(iris)
```
