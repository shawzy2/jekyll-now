title: Data Scientist vs Statistician
---

I think data science is about applying statistics and computer science to business problems. Major knowledge areas include a foundation in probability and statistics, experience in programming languages, and a strong understanding of the language/challenges surrounding a business domain. 

Per this [article](https://mixpanel.com/blog/this-is-the-difference-between-statistics-and-data-science/), data science roles seem to be different from statistician roles in that DS is more about applying statistical principles to problems. Whereas statisticians are likely doing pure research to discover new statistical methods. I see myself more experienced in the former, as my work experience is mostly engineering work.
